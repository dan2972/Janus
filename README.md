# Janus
A 2D Minecraft and RimWorld inspired game that I am working on over the summer break as a college student.
Janus is the Roman god of beginnings, transitions, duality, doorways, and endings.
I wish to create a game where the player is placed in a world with nothing to defend for themselves, trying to build
and craft items and structures to survive while also slowly discovering a history of the past generations where they
crossed dimensional barriers discovering multiple other worlds.
## Features
As the game is currently in its very early stages, there is not much implemented yet.
Here are some features that I have created so far.
All the graphics currently in the game are temporary.

- Chunk-based procedurally generated worlds (of infinite size!)
- Multiple different types of tiles (grass, stone, water, sand)
- Separated game update and rendering systems
- Random ticks and scheduled ticks (much like Minecraft)

## Features  Planned
Although I am unsure whether I will reach the stage of actually creating a full game, here are my
plans on this game.

- Breaking and placing blocks (currently working on it)
- Player inventory system
- Crafting
- Greater building system
- Enemies and turrets
- Randomly generated structures
- Biomes
